            It looks like your proposed title indicates a breaking change. If that's the case,
            please make sure to include a "BREAKING CHANGE:" footer in the body of the pull request
            describing the breaking change and any migration instructions.

            Hey there and thank you for opening this pull request! 👋🏼

            We require pull request titles to follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
            and it looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.

            Your title should look like this. The scope field is optional.
            ```
            <type>(<scope>): <description>
            ```

            If the PR includes a breaking change, mark it with an exclamation mark:
            ```
            <type>!: <description>
            ```
            and include a "BREAKING CHANGE:" footer in the body of the pull request.

            Details:
            ```
            ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message }}
            ```
